# Diffusion-Limited Aggregation
> This repository focuses on experimental trials to calculate the fractal dimension of the model of diffusion-limited aggregation. It contains some examples of DLA cluster for sticking probabilities at nearest neighbor P_{nn} = 1 and P_{nn} = 0.3.

> We calculate the fractal dimension based on its relationship with the density-density function C(r) as given by the linear relationship ln(C(r)) ∼ −α ln(r). Finally, we will use the result obtained for the parameter α to calculate the fractal dimension for both sticking probabilities P<sub>nn</sub> = 1 and P<sub>nn</sub> = 0.3.

> Our experiments give an estimate of 1.691 for the fractal dimension in the case of sticking probability P_{nn} = 0.3 and 1.6661 for sticking probability P_{nn} = 1.
